About:
DependencyCheck is a simple utility that attempts to determine if there is a Common Product Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given project dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

Usage:
Still under development: mvn package site

TODO: 
Add CVE download/indexing and CPE lookup.
Finish report generation.
Fix/finish the CLI.
