About:
DependencyCheck is a simple utility that attempts to determine if there is a 
Common Product Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given project dependency. 
If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

Usage:
Still under development: mvn package site

java -jar dependencycheck-0.1.jar -h

TODO: 
Add CVE download/indexing and CPE lookup.
Finish report generation (xml).
Consider utilizing the OSVDB in addition to CPE/CVE.
